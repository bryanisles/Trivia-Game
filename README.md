============================================================

Q: Who came up with the theories of General and Special relativity?
A: Albert Einstein

Q: Which branch of physics is devoted to the study of heat and related phenomena?
A: Thermodynamics

Q: According to physics, what are the four fundamental forces in nature?
A: Strong, Electromagnetic, Weak, Gravitational Forces

Q: Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment dealing with which type of mechanics?
A: Quantum Mechanics

Q: Who is the author of the book "A Brief History of Time"?
A: Stephen Hawking

Q: What four stats of matter are observable in everyday life?
A: Solid, Liquid, Gas, and Plasma

Q: What is the equation that describes the motion of viscous fluid substances?
A: Naviar-Stokes Equation

Q: What are the four mechanisms for heat transfer?
A: Thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, phase change

Q: How much force is applied against us from the ground?
A: equal to our weight; False: equal to the earth's weight, equal to the gravitation attractive force

Q: In terms of pressure, in order for a fluid to propigate from one location to the other the pressure upstream must be greater than the pressure downstream
A: True

Q: An example of a non-newtonian Fluid is:
A: oobleck; false: milk, water, pitch

Q: Mathematically @ standard conditions, what is the relative mass of Earth to itself @ standard conditions?
A: 1.0; false: 0.5, 0.88, 1.23.

Q: In transport phenomena, what does Reynold's Number describe?
A:   1. It is a comparison between inertial forces and viscous forces;
     2. It is a number that describes the propogation of pressure
     3. It is a comparison between 

Q: In transport phenomena, what does the prandtl number describe?
A:   1.  It is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity
	 2. It is a comparison between the inertial forces and viscous forces

Q: In transport phenomena, what does the Grashof number describe?
A:	1. It is a dimensionaless number inf fluid dynamics and heat trasnfer which approximates the ratio of the buoyancy to viscous force acting on a fluid.  It frequently arises in the stuy od situations involving natural convection and is analgous to the Reynolds number.  It's believed to be named after Franz Grashof.  Though this grouping of terms had already been in use, it wasn't named until around 1921, 28 years after Franz Grashof's death.  It's not very clear why the grouping was named after him.

Q: On a clear cloudless day-time, why is the appearance of the sky blue?
A: Due to the index of refraction, the sky scatters the frequecy of blue light more than red light

Q: What is the JT (Joule-Thompson) Effect?
A: In thermodyanmics, the Joule-Thomson effect describes the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulted so that no heat is exchanged with the environment.  This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule-Thomson process.  At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium, and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule-Thomson process; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures.

Q: Name a compound that exhibits sublimation? 
A: CO2; false: H2O, gasoline, diesel

Q: In thermodynamics, what is a reversible process?
A: a process whose direction can be "reversed" by inducing infintesimal changes to some property of the system via its surroundings, with no increase in entropy.  Throughout the entire reversible process, the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. Since it would take an infinite amount of time for the reversible process to finish, perfectly reversible processes are impossible.  However, if the system undergoing the changes responds much faster than the applied change, the deviation from reversibility may be negligible.  In a reversible cycle, a cyclical reversible process, the system and its surroundings will be returned to their original state if one half cycle is followed by the other half cycle.

Q: For a pure compound held at constant pressure and saturated liquid, what is the temperature relative to the same compound at the same pressure but at the saturated vapor phase.
A: The same

Q: what is critical velocity
A:

A: 180

Q: How many digits of pi are there
A: infinite
